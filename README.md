# Machine setup scripts

Clone the repo, branch, then inspect and possibly modify:

 - `settings.sh` configures OS settings
 - `packages.sh` defines and installs a set of packages
 - `texpackages.rb` installs TeX packages
 - `se.sh` is for Sealed Envelope specific configuration

Then run `dev-box-install.sh`.

Both `packages.sh` and `se.sh` can be run at any time and should be run regularly.
